# Circle-Area-Numerical-Approximation
I demonstrate how to calculate the area of a circle without the use of the formula: A = pi * r^2. This is using the 
Riemann sum method i.e, to divide the circle into almost infinitely many rectangular strips, find a way to calculate 
the area of a general strip and then sum up the area of all the strips to find the total area of the circle (approximately).
The more the number of strips, the greater the accuracy of approximation.
